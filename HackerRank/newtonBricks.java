/* There are n bricks arranged in a row at positions numbered from 1 through n, inclusive. 
There is an array, newtons[n], that contains an integer indicating the number of newtons required to smash a brick. 

There are two hammers, one big and one small. The big hammer can smash any brick with one blow. 
The small hammer reduces the newtons required by 1 for each blow to a brick. For example, a brick requires 3 newtons of force. It will take 7 blow with the big hammer, or 3 blows with the small hammer to smash it. There is a limit to how many times the big hammer can be used.

Determine 3 values:

1. the minimum number of blows to smash all the bricks

2. the 1-based indices of the bricks smashed by the big hammer sorted ascending

3. the 1-based indices of the bricks smashed by the small hammer sorted ascending

Return the values as a 2-dimensional integer array, [[total hits], [big hammer hits], 
[small hammer hits]]. If a hammer is not used, its index array should be [-1]. */
